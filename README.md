**Docker config**  
Dockerfiles and Docker-Compose files + script for jekyll dev enviornment

**Requirements**  
1. Docker
2. Docker Compose

**Instructions**  
1. Run the build script `build.sh` to build the required docker images
2. Run the connect script `connect.sh` to connect to the docker container.  
3. If the docker container is not running (for instance after a reboot), you can use `docker-compose up -d` to start it again, or run the build script a second time.
4. The directory `data` within this repo will be mounted within the container at `/data`.

**Other**  
* The cleanup script `cleanup.sh` simply removes the files generated by the build script.  
(It does not remove the images from docker)
* The `data` directory should persist outside the container
* The build script should create a user inside the docker image with the same UID as the user who runs it.  
(This should allow the contents to be modified outside the containers as well without issue)
